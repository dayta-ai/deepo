This repo is a fork to the modular docker machine learning environment [deepo](https://github.com/ufoym/deepo) which add extra functions include ffmpeg support to opencv, remote server x11 forwarding, better user permission management and more python modules. Keep in mind that not all functions are tested.

## Usecases
![Usecases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dayta-ai/deepo/master/images/usecases.jpg)


## How to use

### Prerequisite (docker host os)
1. Socat (For remote usage)
```bash
sudo apt install -y socat
```
2. Edit sshd settings (For remote usage)

use your text editor to edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config
set X11Forwarding to yes
set X11UseLocalhost to no

3. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dayta-ai/deepo.git
```

### Prerequisite (Client)

1. Install [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) (For Mac only)

### How to use it in headless mode(TLDR)
1. add execution permission to start_local.sh
```bash
cd deepo
chmod u+x start_local.sh
```
2. Build docker image and run the container, the container will be removed after you exit from bash
```bash
./start_local.sh -d your_name
```

### How to use it locally with GUI(TLDR)
1. add execution permission to start_local.sh
```bash
cd deepo
chmod u+x start_local.sh
```
2. Build docker image and run the container, the container will be removed after you exit from bash
```bash
./start_local.sh -d your_name
```
### How to use it remotely with GUI(TLDR)
1. ssh to your remote workstation with x11 forwarding flags
```bash
ssh -XY my_workstation
```
2. add execution permission to start_remote.sh
```bash
cd deepo
chmod u+x start_remote.sh
```
3. Build docker image and run the container, the container will be removed after you exit from bash
```bash
./start_remote.sh -d your_name
```

## Docker Image
![Docker Image Layer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dayta-ai/deepo/master/images/layers.jpg)

### Base image
By default, the base docker image is prebuild by us and host by [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/dayta/ml_development), here are the included libraries and tools
1. ubuntu 18.04
2. cuda 10.0 and cudnn 7
3. python 3.7
4. opencv with ffmpeg support
5. pytorch 1.1 + torchvision 0.3 / pytorch 1.2 + torchvision 0.4  & apex
6. jupyer and jupyter lab
7. tensorflow 1.14 & keras
8. mxnet
9. sklearn
10. onnx
11. vim and nano
12. net-tools

#### Update base image
```bash
docker pull dayta/ml_developmen:latest
```

#### Build your own base image (Optional)
Please follow the guide from original deepo repo
```bash
cd generator
python generate.py Dockerfile python==3.7 pytorch==1.1 apex jupyter tensorflow==1.14 keras onnx opencv sklearn pylint mxnet --ubuntu-ver 18.04 --cuda-ver 10.0 --cudnn-ver 7
docker build -t daytabase/ml_development .
```

### Other info
1. Container name

*DeveloperName_Project_index*

The suffix of container name indicate the index of container, you can multiple containers at the same time by run start.sh multiple times. ~~To do: make container index incremental~~ Containers from different developers are distinguished by the DEVELOPER_NAME prefix

2. User password

The default password is docker, feel free to change it in the outer Dockerfile

3. Webcam

~~Currently you have to add --privileged argument to docker run command in start.sh in order to use webcam~~
Updated: no privileged is needed to access webcam from container, all webcams under /dev/ will be mounted

4. Multiple GPUs

If the host machine has multiple GPUs, you can specify the GPUs you want to use by setting GPU variable in the script. By default first one is chosen.

5. Initialization script

An initilaization script(scripts/init.sh) is used to run commands when the container starts. For example, Jupyter notebook is automatically started with the container. Each container is associated with an unique jupyter notebook port, starting from 8888.
